Summary Orc’estra presents itself as a pioneer in gamification in Brazil # In the September 4 meeting, the junior company Orc’estra, linked to UnB Gama’s Software Engineering program, presented its trajectory and activity as the first Brazilian student organization dedicated exclusively to gamification — within the Gamificação.ORG meeting.\nStudent Bryan Leite, representing the organization, emphasized that the group’s mission is to “reframe people’s lives by bringing productivity and pleasure together.” Orc’estra focuses on developing solutions that apply game techniques to foster engagement and results in different contexts.\nService portfolio # Gamification design — needs assessment and tailored solutions. Software conception — requirements structuring and high‑fidelity prototype development. Gamified development — building or maintaining systems with gamification elements. Among the success cases are projects with Unimed (promoting healthy habits); the “Ao Encontro” app, which helps search for lost animals; and Alegro, an international marketplace aiming to strengthen users’ sense of belonging.\nStructure and organizational culture # The company is organized with two presidencies (institutional and organizational) and four directorates: Communication and Marketing (Decom), Projects, Business (Debis), and Operations (Tops).\nMembers describe the internal culture as collaborative and family‑like. There are practices for activity follow‑up, climate surveys, and overload prevention. “Orc’estra is not just a junior company; it’s a family,” Bryan said.\nRelationship with the community # New members are selected through periodic processes announced on social networks such as Instagram and LinkedIn. Although registered with a CNPJ, Orc’estra is non‑profit: all revenue is reinvested in its own operation.\nAt the end of the presentation, professors and peers highlighted Orc’estra’s relevance as a space for practical and entrepreneurial training within UnB — in the scope of the Gamificação.ORG meeting.\nResources Orc\u0026#39;estra\u0026#39;s Site Jul 10, 2025 · Meeting Partnership Video soon Lucas · Porto DigitalInnovation ecosystem and collaboration opportunities. Jun 22, 2025 · Meeting Project Video soon George · SuperRSuperR: a gamified, project‑based approach brought to life at UnB. Summary SuperR: a gamified course comes to life at UnB # In the June 22, 2025 meeting, professor George presented the SuperR project, an initiative that combines gamification and project‑based learning (PBL) in the Software Requirements course at the University of Brasília — within the Gamificação.ORG meeting.\nAccording to the instructor, the proposal originated in 2023 from student motivation indicators and retrospective analyses applied across different cohorts. The goal was to face recurring challenges — dropout, failures, and engagement difficulties — by offering a more interactive and personalized experience.\nHow SuperR works # The strategy was tested with two classes: one with traditional PBL and another combining PBL and gamification.\nFictional narratives were created in a galaxy named Calamo Kairelli, where students, organized into factions, carried out missions and operations tied to the course learning objectives for each unit.\nThe project involved 18 operations grouped into four major missions, with in‑class dynamics.\nElements such as avatars, badges, rewards, and an interactive galaxy map on Miro guided students through the experience.\nEvaluation and results # Motivational questionnaires inspired by Octalysis were applied, along with qualitative feedback collected for each unit.\nThe class with gamification showed a lower dropout rate (8%) and higher retention (91.8%), outperforming the traditional cohorts.\nDespite higher initial cognitive load, attention, satisfaction, and confidence indicators improved over the semester.\nTeam performance was superior, positively impacting pass rates and final grades.\nOutcomes # SuperR generated a gamification guide, its own visual identity, badges, and even a Power Apps prototype to support activities. The project also inspired undergraduate theses and opened paths for future research using data mining and machine learning to predict motivational profiles and adapt dynamics in real time — within the Gamificação.ORG meeting.\nResources SuperR — Project page Prof. George Marsicano Jun 5, 2025 · Meeting Guest Video soon Leda · IBICTCanal Ciência bets on gamification to engage youth. Summary Canal Ciência bets on gamification to engage youth # On June 5, 2025, researcher Leda Sampson, from the Brazilian Institute of Information in Science and Technology (IBICT), presented to the Gamificação.ORG group the transformation of Canal Ciência — a traditional science outreach portal created in 2002 — into a gamified environment.\nAccording to Leda, the portal was born to bring Brazilian science closer to society, especially students and teachers. Over time, long texts no longer resonated with newer generations. This led to the creation of educational games (puzzles, quizzes, memory games) and, more recently, a broader gamification approach.\nThe Galactic Journey # With support from UnB researchers, Canal Ciência launched the “Galactic Journey”, a narrative that turns visitors into space explorers in search of knowledge.\nThe experience includes missions, ranks, medals, and digital rewards. The first mission, already available, takes the user from Earth to the Space Station; the second, in development, will reach the Moon. The goal is for learning to happen naturally, embedded in challenges and stories connected to the portal’s existing scientific content.\nCreation process # To structure the gamification, the team used the Octalysis framework, applying three audience‑diagnosis strategies:\nInternal discussions with subject‑matter experts (the “judges” step); Questionnaires applied directly in schools; Forms available on the portal itself. The collected data enabled mapping users’ motivational profiles and designing mechanics suitable for a mostly young audience.\nResults and outlook # The project brought visibility to IBICT, yielded papers in international venues, and already inspires new initiatives. Despite resource constraints, the team plans to expand the journey to Pluto, completing all planned missions.\nFor Leda, the differentiator lies in uniting innovation, science, and entertainment: “Science outreach must be fun. When users dive into an engaging narrative, they learn without realizing they are studying.”\nResources Canal Ciência — official site Galactic Journey Researcher CV (Lattes) Article: Crafting Personalized Learning Environme...

Summary Banco do Brasil bets on gamification to engage employees # On May 22, 2025, representatives from Banco do Brasil presented to the Gamificação.ORG group the institution’s initiatives using gamification for internal training and engagement.\nStrategy and goals # Banco do Brasil has used game mechanics to make corporate learning more appealing and to encourage employee participation. The premise is that playful experiences can reinforce learning, improve content retention, and increase engagement in strategic programs.\nInitiatives presented # Gamified learning paths — content organized as tracks with challenges, rewards, and immediate feedback; Friendly competition — leaderboards and team missions to foster collaboration and performance; Digital recognition — medals, points, and badges awarded according to participant progress. Results observed # According to the presenters, gamification led to higher adherence to trainings, lower dropout rates in internal courses, and positive reports on motivation and engagement. Qualitative results suggest that combining competition and collaboration can transform the organization’s learning culture.\nNext steps # The institution plans to expand the use of gamification in different areas, exploring new narratives and game dynamics. The goal is to integrate learning further into daily work routines, aligning training with the strategic challenges of the financial sector.\nResources May 8, 2025 · Meeting Talk Watch video Prof. Sergio FreitasProf. Sergio Freitas’ talk — past, present, and future of gamification. Summary Prof. Sergio Freitas — past, present, and future of gamification # In the Gamificação.ORG meeting, Prof. Sergio Freitas — project coordinator and head of the CEDIS gamification area — presented an in‑depth analysis of the field’s past, present, and future.\nHe noted that the term “gamification” emerged in 2002, but gained academic relevance in 2011 after Sebastian Deterding’s paper. Since then, practice spread across companies and universities with varied, yet often positive, results. According to Freitas, early success was driven by intuitive uses of game techniques anchored in age‑old psychological patterns — rewards and punishments — long present in social life and studied by behaviorism.\nEarly simplifications # Many initial applications were simplified setups (“hard rock gamification”) based only on points, badges, and leaderboards (PBL). While effective short‑term, these designs showed limits to sustaining motivation.\nThe 2015 shift: Octalysis # A turning point came in 2015 with Yu‑kai Chou’s Octalysis Framework, which systematized links between game mechanics and psychological theories — especially behaviorism and Self‑Determination Theory.\nFrameworks and rigor # Freitas noted that only around 3% of papers published up to 2023 explicitly used structured frameworks. Even so, tools like Octalysis, Hexad, and Bartle underscored the importance of more systematic processes to design consistent gamification.\nHe emphasized Brazil’s role as a major international hub, with highlights in education and software engineering research.\nFuture challenges # Persistence — ensure designs sustain motivation over time. Indicators — develop stronger metrics to assess motivational and organizational impact. Popularization — democratize access so everyday users can craft and apply techniques in daily life. In closing, Freitas reinforced that gamification should be understood as a strategy to motivate people, and that progress depends on integrating psychology, technology, and data analysis.\nResources Research area: Gamification at CEDIS Apr 3, 2025 · Meeting Thesis Video soon Denniel William Roriz LimaDenniel’s research points paths for gamification in agile development. Summary Research by Denniel highlights paths for gamification in agile development # On April 3, 2025, student Denniel William Roriz Lima presented his undergraduate thesis to the Gamificação.ORG group, focused on applying gamification in agile software development processes.\nContext and problem # Agile methods arose to counter the rigidity of traditional models, offering flexibility and faster delivery. Yet, motivation and engagement challenges persist even within agile. Gamification emerges as an alternative, though empirical studies remain scarce and adoption in software engineering is limited.\nResearch objectives # The project aims to define guidelines for using gamification in agile processes, with specific goals to:\nIdentify challenges and tested solutions; Map evaluation metrics; Systematize practices as a guide for practitioners. Theoretical basis # The review spans agile methodologies (XP, Scrum, FDD, Lean) and gamification frameworks, notably:\nHexad — player‑type profiling (philanthropists, socializers, achievers, etc.); 6D Framework — six steps to implement gamification; Octalysis — eight core drives balancing intrinsic/extrinsic, white/black hat motivations. Preliminary results # 114 Scopus papers analyzed, with co‑authorship and keyword mapping; Scrum was the only agile method to form its “own node”, signaling higher relevance; Recurring association between gamification, motivation, and practices like prototyping and testing; Temporal analysis shows recent growth in publications and renewed interest. Next steps # Expand the review to other databases (ACM, IEEE); Conduct practitioner interviews; Draft a practical guide for applying gamification in agile development. Reception # Faculty and peers praised the dense literature review and clarity of preliminary results, while suggesting caution about relying on a single database and encouraging continuation at the master’s level. Prof. Sergio Freitas noted that a structured guide already represents a relevant contribution to the field.\nResources Jan 30, 2025 · Meeting Master\u0026#39;s Video soon Luciana Assis · EmbrapaEmbrapa research applies gamification to asset management and reports advances.

Summary Gamification in the Military Police: potential and challenges # On January 16, 2025, Capt. Públio Cavalcante (Military Police) presented a study on using gamification in police intelligence reports.\nObjective and method # The study assessed whether gamification could improve the quality of intelligence reports. It applied Intrinsic Motivation Inventory (IMI), Octalysis‑based motivational profiling, and a comparison between units using or not a gamified reporting system.\nImplementation # The Ippon Web system was adapted with medals, leaderboards, virtual coins, and anonymous peer feedback. Each report was evaluated by three different people; scores fed individual and team profiles. Techniques included social reinforcement, immediate feedback, and achievement progression.\nResults and perceptions # Intangible: higher engagement from officers as they felt read and evaluated; rare peer feedback in the military environment improved text and image quality. Quantitative: independent evaluations showed slightly higher scores for gamified reports. Limitations: only 6/19 planned techniques implemented; short pilot window constrained robust effects. Institutional challenges # Command changes led to pausing gamification, prioritizing administrative use of the system. Cultural and institutional maturity are needed to sustain such innovations.\nConclusion # Gamification can engage agents and improve intelligence reporting, but faces constraints of time, culture, and continuity.

The context was Canal Ciência (IBICT), a science outreach portal for students and teachers. The audience heterogeneity (children to adults) required multiple diagnostic strategies.\nThree strategies # Expert assessment: judges analyzed motivational profiles using Octalysis; In‑person dynamics: games like “The problem in my school/city” and “My other half is with you” applied in classrooms; Adapted questionnaires: forms for children, teens, and adults, based on the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory. Results highlighted social influence, unpredictability, and creative empowerment as key drives to engage the audience.\nFrom theory to practice # The mapping led to the “Galactic Journey” narrative, turning visitors into space explorers. The first mission, already launched, addresses environmental disasters (floods, wildfires). The next, in development, takes users to the International Space Station.\nMonitoring and outlook # Impact is being tracked with Google Analytics and internal performance metrics (ranks, medals, mission progression). Despite initial increases in access and retention, the researchers caution it is too early to assert causality.\nThe study opens paths for future research and reinforces integrating motivational diagnostics with business metrics — also echoed in partnerships with organizations such as Banco do Brasil.\nResources Project page — Canal Ciência Article: A Process to Identify Players’ Motivatio...

Summary Gamification proposal for software project management # On December 5, 2024, Gamificação.ORG hosted Bruno Mello Andrade, who presented his research proposal for a qualification in the Graduate Program in Applied Computing. The focus is to apply gamification to software project management processes, especially in software factories operating in the public sector.\nMotivation challenge # Drawing from experience in a software factory with public contracts, Bruno noted that professional motivation often narrows to financial incentives. The proposal explores gamification to engage managers and teams beyond money, defining objective criteria for bonus distribution and fostering healthy competition across projects.\nGame structure (on Jira) # Built on Jira, widely used by the company:\nEach manager “owns” a project and creates a customizable character; Planning, scope updates, and adequate Jira usage award points and badges; Indicators include finished tasks, updated backlog, team communication, and client evaluation; Accumulated score multiplies existing bonuses, adding a playful layer to the rewards system. Evaluation and indicators # The model combines productivity metrics (completed tasks, execution time, open defects) and motivational metrics (team satisfaction, engagement, collaboration). Assessment compares before/after gamification using the GQM method (Goal–Question–Metric) to align business goals, research questions, and metrics.\nCritiques and suggestions # Cristiane Soares Ramos: strengthen alignment between indicators and GQM; beware of reducing everything to money; Luciana Assis: broaden the repertoire of game mechanics (collaboration, motivational profiles) to prevent excessive competition; Davi Rocha: leverage the Hexad model to map individual motivations and tailor techniques to team profiles. Outlook # Bruno acknowledged sustainability and team‑engagement challenges and the need to balance extrinsic (bonuses) and intrinsic (recognition, collaboration) motivations.

R. T., FREITAS, S. A. A., RAMOS, C. S.\n10th Intelligent Systems Conference\nThis paper proposes the incorporation of gamification with machine learning for the development of chatbots. The Gamified Chatbot Development Process (GCMP), is a process for the development of gamified chatbots, it comprises eight activities, arranged into four steps, emphasizing gamification implementation. This process includes gamification planning, gamification management, updating chatbot content, chatbot behavior implementation, chatbot behavior validation, chatbot behavior analysis, chatbot delivery, and chatbot usage analysis. GCMP provides a clear and structured guide, allowing flexibility to accommodate each project’s specific requirements. This article describes the methodology employed, which includes the application of an experiment with software engineering students. The experiment is conducted by providing documents, holding weekly meetings, and collecting pertinent data. The applicability of GCMP in gamified chatbot projects is examined, and a new version of the process is proposed to resolve the gaps found, and conclusions are drawn based on experiments.\nDOI dissertation Gamified Chatbot Management Process: A way to build gamified chatbotsArthur Rocha Temporim de Lacerda\nChatbot development frameworks provide a range of construction methods; however, established processes like the Chatbot Management Process (CMP) often lack activities specifically tailored to enhance user engagement. This thesis presents the Gamified Chatbot Management Process (GCMP), an extension of the CMP that integrates and adapts activities to boost user interaction with chatbots. Three iterations of the GCMP were created, each incorporating enhancements driven by the Goal-Question-Metric (GQM) methodology. This iterative approach supported the continuous evaluation and evolution of the process. Experiments with real users indicated positive engagement, with all participants successfully meeting the set objectives. Furthermore, the average deployment time was reduced by 66% from the initial to the final version. User assessments also gave top ratings for the quality of responses generated by the chatbot. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed GCMP. The findings suggest a strong positive correlation between implementing the GCMP and improvements in developing gamified chatbots. The advances in both chatbot functionality and gamification techniques highlight the potential for widespread adoption of the GCMP as a reliable and effective approach for creating gamified chatbots.\nAccess 2023 conference Gamification in Organizational Contexts: A Systematic Literature ReviewASSIS, L.

Considered a tool aimed at increasing engagement, gamification can be applied across various areas, including organizational activities. This work proposes a Case Study at the Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation (Embrapa), analyzing the effects of a gamification solution applied to the Innovation Macroprocess (MPI), which is responsible for managing research, development, and innovation solutions for the sustainability of the Brazilian agribusiness. The main goal is to evaluate the effectiveness of gamification in enhancing engagement, collaboration, and motivation of employees regarding the use of the Asset Management System (Gestec), a computational tool that implements part of the MPI. Initially, a study of the theoretical foundations of gamification was conducted, followed by a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) to investigate the main frameworks, techniques, and effects of gamification solutions in organizational environments. Subsequently, a Case Study was initiated with the identification of the motivational profile of the target audience and the development of a project that includes the application of sixteen gamification requirements. Of these, ten requirements were prioritized and implemented for the experimentation phase, which was made available to a group of twenty-seven participants to evaluate the effects of the proposed solution. Overall, the results indicated an improvement in the motivational perception regarding the use of the system.\nAccess dissertation Evaluation of the change in report quality with the application of gamification in police intelligence activitiesPúblio Pastrolin Cavalcante\nThe gamification of non-playful activities has gained traction in the industrial, service, and educational sectors, demonstrating that introducing game elements into an environment can make activities more engaging, fun, and enjoyable. This approach has proven to be an effective strategy for motivating and involving individuals, recognized as a valuable tool for managers. In the context of the Military Police of the Federal District, which is responsible for overt policing and maintaining public order in the nation\u0026#39;s capital, Intelligence Activity plays a crucial role in supporting strategic, tactical, and operational decisions. This study introduces the Gamified Intelligence Reporting Process (GIRP), developed for the Military Police Intelligence System. The gamification model was based on the Octalysis framework, supplemented by statistical techniques derived from the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory and document analyses. The aim of the GIRP is to improve the quality of intelligence reports through gamification, benefiting from an iterative evaluation and planning process. Additionally, the work provides a theoretical foundation on gamification, Intelligence Activity, Public Security, and an overview of the Military Police of the Federal District.\nAccess tcc Journey - the use of RPG in a learning processJoão Vitor Lopes de Farias\nIn the last decade gamification has gained greater prominence due to its ability to generate motivation and engagement by applying game elements in non-gaming contexts. The accession of gamification in the teaching process is a way to encourage the participation and constancy of students during learning. The RPG (Role-Playing Game) is a genre of game characterized mainly by four elements - the story narrative, the characters, the progress system and the challenges. These RPG elements are key to generating interest in players. When applied in the teaching environment, the RPG can promote greater interaction and immersion of students. Taking this into consideration, this work presents a learning process that applies gamification concepts together with RPG elements, called Jornada, whose proposal is to increase student engagement and motivation. From the application of this process in a Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) class at the University of Brasilia (UnB), it was possible to collect information used to evaluate the feasibility of using the process in the classroom.\nAccess tcc University of Heuristics - A Game to Support Learning Nielsen\u0026#39;s HeuristicsLucas Naves Cauê Oliveira\nAccess tcc Implementation of a support application for the gamified course in HCIÍtalo Alves Guimarães\nThis project aims to present the implementation of an application for the gamified discipline of Human-Computer Interaction at the University of Brasília (UnB).

REVISTA NOVAS TECNOLOGIAS NA EDUCAÇÃO\nDOI dissertation REQGAME - Requirements Elicitation with Gamification - An Experiment in Software Projects in a Federal Public AgencyAna Cláudia Alves Mendes Araújo\nThe success of a software project is closely linked to the clarity and accuracy of its requirements. These requirements outline the project scope and establish the expected operation of the software. Thus, the requirement elicitation phase is a critical milestone in the software development lifecycle, demanding excellent communication, cooperation, and motivation skills among all stakeholders. However, challenges such as effective collaboration and scheduling coordination can compromise engagement and active participation in this process. To overcome these obstacles and stimulate participation, gamification has proven to be an effective strategy by applying game mechanics in non-game contexts. Within this framework, Octalysis, a gamification framework developed by Yu-Kai Chou, offers a methodology to tailor and customize gamification according to the user profiles involved. This study introduces REQGame, an innovative method that integrates gamification into the requirement elicitation process, based on the Octalysis framework. The aim is to enhance the involvement and engagement of participants, also evaluating the positive effects that the implementation of gamification techniques can bring to the process.\ntcc Systematic literature review on the use of frameworks in the construction of gamification in educationWeiller Fernandes Pereira\nThe application of gamified processes in the field of education has become increasingly common over the last few decades. Each project has unique characteristics, utilizing different techniques and being applied across various modalities and levels of education. However, creating a gamification is not just about inserting game elements into a given activity. There are tools designed to assist in this creation process, providing a step-by-step guide that contains methods and mechanics to be followed by those wishing to develop a gamified project. This work presents a systematic review of the literature, aiming to find these tools, referred to as gamification frameworks or models, and to combine the data found with other extracted criteria such as the countries and the educational levels where these frameworks are used. This review was divided into three stages - planning, execution, and summarization. In the planning stage, the research question, search string, acceptance criteria, and information to be extracted were defined. In the execution, the review is carried out, with the selection of primary studies and data extraction. In the summarization, the results are generated through graphs. At the end, an evaluation was conducted, considering the results obtained on the use of gamification frameworks in conjunction with other extraction criteria used in the review.\nAccess 2019 conference Uso do algoritmo Apriori na avaliação da motivação em uma gamificaçãoLEMES, R.

Distraction occurs in an instant; a moment of inattention is all it takes for everyone to start checking notifications on their phones. The speed at which new technologies and software are adopted is only matched by the speed at which they are abandoned. Against this backdrop, an emerging strategy in various fields is the incorporation of playful elements as a means of fostering engagement, a concept known as gamification. While gamification proves to be a promising approach, it is essential that it continuously evolves to remain appealing and aligned with the expectations and development of its audience. A thorough analysis of a gamified initiative, aimed at identifying areas for improvement, is crucial for determining directions for evolution. Therefore, this study aims to define a strategy that enables the identification of potential improvements in gamified applications. Such improvements are highlighted by the evaluation of project indicators that measure usability and by direct feedback from users after testing the application. Direct interaction with users allows adjustments to be informed by the perspectives of those the project is intended for. The convergence of users\u0026#39; views in favor of the suggested improvements validates the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.\nAccess 2017 conference Uso da gamificação nos anos iniciais do ensino fundamental brasileiroCUNHA, GEOVÂNIA, BARRAQUI, LUCIANA, FREITAS, S.

There have emerged, both in academia and in the market, technological solutions for several areas, among them education. On the other hand, classroom teaching and learning continues to suffer from classical educational problems such as lack of student and teacher motivation and lack of clear educational goals. And although software supports learning across a range of disciplines and ages, childrens audiences, especially in mathematics, have been little contemplated with the benefits that technological solutions can bring. Therefore, the use of pedagogical approaches, such as Blooms Taxonomy and Formative Assessments, together with gamification techniques, such as Octalysis, can be used to develop a technological solution that contemplates this public. The present work aims to design and develop software to assist the teaching and learning of mathematics for children in the classroom. Among the results obtained are the design of gamification in Octalysis, the types of questions and pedagogical approach to be used, besides the software itself in operation.\nAccess tcc Application of Gamification in the About Social NetworkTiago Ribeiro de Assunção\nIn recent years, social media platforms have gained significant visibility in the technological landscape, becoming a predominant channel for communication and information dissemination among digital users. The Social Network About (RSA), a platform developed by a student from the University of Brasília, exemplifies this phenomenon by attracting users for initial use. However, it faces challenges in retaining these users over the long term. Gamification emerges as a promising methodology in this context, employing techniques designed to motivate and engage users in performing specific activities, maintaining their interest through different stages of software interaction. This study proposes the integration of a gamification framework into the Social Network About (RSA), positioning itself as a technological development project. The aim is to overcome the user retention challenges identified in RSA by applying gamification principles that encourage continuous and engaged user participation. Through this approach, the goal is not only to increase the platform\u0026#39;s usage time but also to enrich the user experience, promoting a deeper and more meaningful engagement with the social network. Therefore, this work represents a valuable contribution to the field of social software development, by exploring the application of gamification strategies as a means to improve the user-platform interaction dynamics in social networks.\nAccess 2016 conference Gamificação e avaliação do engajamento dos estudantes em uma disciplina técnica de curso de graduaçãoFREITAS, S.

This project proposes the creation of a tool that, through the use of gamification elements, allows the user to shape that motivation. The idea of using gamification to make people feel as motivated in real life as they do while playing has been explored by various authors in recent years. Integrating technology with gamification aims to extend the reach of gamification to the public. Gamification not only uses game elements to motivate but also generates engagement, making people committed to their personal goals, corporate objectives, or any other cause where gamification is applied. The development of the tool began with a literature review, from which a specific gamification model was selected to form the core of the tool. The initial proposal was crafted with the intention of providing users with a support tool for the construction of gamification projects. The developed tool aligns with this philosophy.\nAccess tcc Gamified Learning Environment for Teaching AlgorithmsWilker Mesquita de Assunção\nThe use of software has been increasingly popular in society, including in virtual learning environments. As technology advances, pedagogical methods have evolved, giving rise to new approaches aimed at leveraging these advancements to enhance teaching and learning processes. This study introduces the adaptation of a virtual learning environment for teaching algorithms, employing Gamification techniques as proposed by Yu-kai Chou, in conjunction with the educational strategies developed by Salman Khan. The virtual learning environment Moodle was used to structure a fully gamified course on algorithms, supported by the software Funifier and Scratch. The online course, lasting one month, is structured into weekly tasks that cover the basic concepts of computational algorithms, incorporating established gamification elements such as points, badges, and leaderboards, aiming to effectively engage and motivate students.\nAccess 2014 tcc Search System in a Virtual Learning Environment Based on ProfilesPedro Henrique Potiguara Carvalho\nThis work aims to model and implement the search part of a virtual learning environment, taking into account both the group profile of the user performing the search and their individual profile.
