      ### Systematic Literature Review on Gamification for Software Quality Improvement

      On October 24, 2025, Lucas Pereira Gomes Linard presented the methodology and progress of his master's research systematic literature review (SLR) on gamification applied to software development quality. His research focuses on understanding how gamification can stimulate developers to write higher-quality code at Banco do Brasil.

      #### Research motivation and background

      Lucas works as a programmer in the Software Quality area at Banco do Brasil. Through empirical observation validated with academic rigor by Professor Sérgio, he identified a critical behavior: developers improve code quality only up to the point where they don't need approval from their manager. Beyond that threshold, code quality improvements stagnate, regardless of the severity of issues.

      The research explores whether gamification techniques can overcome this motivation barrier and incentivize developers to proactively improve code quality, particularly in addressing accumulated technical debt.

      #### Systematic Literature Review methodology

      Lucas shared his practical workflow for conducting the SLR:

      - **Protocol and planning**: Developed a quality assessment checklist and study selection criteria
      - **Study search and selection**: Searched multiple databases, retrieving 1,324 total articles (1,293 non-duplicated), with 1,149 rejected at title/abstract level and 82 accepted for full-text reading
      - **Data extraction and organization**: Created a private repository with PDF storage, automated bibliography synchronization, and standardized extraction forms
      - **Quality assessment**: Evaluated studies based on abstract and title during initial screening; plans to re-evaluate after full-text reading for potential reclassification
      - **Snowballing technique**: Identified relevant references from included studies using structured tagging (yellow = general notes, green = gamification aspects, blue = relevant metrics, red = errors/disagreements)
      - **Leveraging AI/LLMs**: Used tools like Claude to organize extracted data, search across 10+ initial articles, and identify patterns linking research findings to proposed gamification strategies

      #### Key findings from research conducted so far

      Among the first 11 articles analyzed:

      - **Gamification techniques identified**: Various techniques including leaderboards, ranking systems, badges, and incentives for specific tasks
      - **Metrics used**: Static code analysis metrics (SonarQube violations), vulnerability density, test coverage, compliance with standards, and technical debt measurements
      - **Quality definition**: The research standardizes "quality" to focus on SonarQube static analysis rule violations, as these are directly actionable by developers and measurable. This aligns with Banco do Brasil's current quality framework using default SonarQube rules
      - **Lead time concerns**: Despite being a key research question, Lucas found minimal evidence in literature about gamification's impact on development time. This remains an open gap—a concern expressed by business stakeholders: does improving code quality increase deployment time, thus negating business value?

      #### Research proposal direction

      The SLR findings inform Lucas's gamification proposal design for Banco do Brasil. Planned features include:

      - **Refactoring missions**: Gamified missions to reduce code complexity or address technical debt without requiring new feature delivery (e.g., "Reduce method complexity from 8 to 5 and earn 5 coins")
      - **Evidence-based technique selection**: Using SLR findings to choose gamification mechanics with documented effectiveness in similar contexts
      - **Context-specific adaptation**: Applying gamification to quality improvements while maintaining business focus on lead time and delivery schedules
      - **Simulation analysis**: Lucas previously conducted Monte Carlo simulations showing that 2 hours per sprint per developer dedicated to technical debt reduction could significantly improve code health without major productivity loss

      #### Research organization strategy

      Lucas demonstrated how he organizes extracted data to map research evidence to his proposal:

      - **Single source of truth**: All data extraction centralized in one repository format for consistency and LLM processing
      - **Evidence mapping**: Linking each research question to specific articles and their findings (e.g., articles S2, S3, S5, S8, S11 address "What gamification techniques are used?")
      - **Concept normalization**: Planning to standardize synonymous terms across papers (e.g., "leaderboard" vs. "ranking") to get a comprehensive view of technique usage
      - **Slide summaries for advisor**: Each article receives a one-page summary slide (in GammaApp) documenting the inclusion/exclusion rationale and relationship to research questions

      #### Feedback from the community

      - **Profa. Cristiane**: Emphasized the importance of clear research questions and how extracted evidence answers them; suggested maintaining a single authoritative source for data extraction
      - **Luciana**: Noted the challenge of finding lead-time evidence in literature; recommended broadening the search to general software quality and maintenance literature to capture indirect evidence of time savings
      - **Bruno**: Highlighted the importance of clearly defining "quality" to scope the work; praised the standardization of SonarQube rules as the quality benchmark
      - **Prof. Sergio**: Congratulated Lucas on the rich presentation and encouraged completion of the SLR, proposal development, and qualification phases

      #### Next steps

      - Complete the systematic literature review (currently reading 82 selected articles; early results available from first 11)
      - Normalize terminology across extracted data
      - Finalize evidence mapping linking SLR findings to gamification proposal design
      - Develop and test the gamification proposal with Banco do Brasil development teams
      - Measure both quality improvements and lead-time impact to validate business viability

      The research demonstrates rigorous academic methodology applied to a real-world software engineering challenge, combining literature evidence with practical industry context to inform innovation in developer motivation and code quality.

      ### Gamification in Software Project Management: Implementation and Results

      On October 3, 2025, Bruno Mello Andrade presented preliminary results of his master's dissertation to the Gamificação.ORG community. The work addresses gamification applied to IT management teams in a software factory context, evaluating impact on engagement and productivity.

      #### Research context and motivation

      Bruno works managing operations for a software factory in Brasília with over 8 contracts for the public sector (recently including Caixa Econômica). The company faces challenges typical of the sector: contracts awarded to lowest bidders, staff motivation constraints beyond salary increases, and the need to maintain productivity and code quality under competitive pressures.

      The research investigates whether gamification techniques can address motivational barriers in professional software development, focusing initially on the management layer to create a cascade effect toward development teams.

      #### Research methodology

      **Timeline of activities:**
      - Literature review on gamification
      - Research proposal and qualification defense
      - Team engagement survey (IMI questionnaire) with 12 management responses across 7 motivational subscales
      - Mapping of gamification techniques using the Hexad model of player motivations
      - Gamification implementation on Telebrás contract (pilot)
      - Data collection and ongoing analysis (September-November 2025)

      #### Gamification implementation strategy

      Bruno implemented gamification integrated into existing tools (Jira for task management; Confluence for documentation) without requiring additional systems, ensuring adoption feasibility.

      **Gamification techniques applied:**

      1. **Narrative** (Epic Core – Utility Value): Crafted a project story using user story documentation, establishing game rules, achievements, and recognition wall.

      2. **Unexpected Reward** (Empowerment & Creativity Core): Spontaneous peer recognition mechanism on a Confluence wall, with clear guidelines for acknowledgment.

      3. **Elitism** (Empowerment & Creativity Core): Visual ranking of team members with highest task closures per sprint, recognized with badges.

      4. **Hero of Humanity** (Empowerment & Creativity Core): Recognition badge for individuals receiving the most peer feedback.

      5. **Sky of Brigadeiro** (Accomplishment Core): Dashboard displaying sprint progress, task status (open, in development, completed), and backlog metrics with visual feedback.

      6. **Real-time Control** (Accomplishment Core): Graphical visualization of task closure progress and sprint health indicators.

      7. **Achievements (Badges)** (Belongingness & Social Core): 6 distinct badges earned for:
         - Completing 2+ sprints per month
         - Maintaining error rate below 5%
         - Meeting planned operational results
         - Customer satisfaction ratings ≥ 8
         - 2+ years tenure at company
         - Zero billing disputes (premium badge)

      8. **Special Missions** (Belongingness & Social Core): Gamified tasks outside daily workflow (e.g., process improvements, documentation updates, task maintenance) that contribute to company health and technical debt reduction.

      **Evaluation and reward system:**
      - Bi-weekly evaluation: 80%+ sprint closure = 1 point; 60%+ backlog completion = 1 point
      - Monthly evaluation: 3+ peer recognitions = 1 point; mission completion = 1 point; badges earned = 1 point per badge
      - Quality metrics: Max 10% defect items per sprint
      - Final reward: Top 3 managers receive 3, 2, and 1 days of paid leave (decided by score ranking)

      #### Results and findings

      **Positive outcomes:**
      - Improved data quality: fewer forgotten/unclosed tasks (previously tasks would languish for 40+ hours)
      - Better task tracking and closure rates
      - Team engagement: verbal feedback indicated satisfaction ("light, fun, engaging")
      - Institutional impact: company requested implementation expansion to other contracts
      - Increased awareness of process and productivity tracking (important for CMM-I maturity assessments)

      **Challenges and limitations:**
      - Recognition mechanisms (peer feedback wall, special missions) show low adoption—cultural resistance to activities perceived as "extra work"
      - Limited improvement in motivational indices (IMI questionnaire) compared to behavioral metrics
      - Interaction patterns between professionals did not visibly improve; feedback culture remains weak
      - Task complexity not factored into scoring (potential for gaming: selecting easy tasks instead of challenging work)
      - No direct measurement of impact on engineering team motivation (only management layer surveyed)
      - Data collection still ongoing; final analysis pending

      #### Community feedback and recommendations

      **Professora Cristiane Ramos** highlighted the success of keeping gamification aligned with existing daily workflows rather than introducing extra steps. Key observations:
      - Recognition wall and special missions diverge from daily practices; consider root cause analysis for low adoption
      - Suggest incorporating task complexity/story points into scoring to prevent bias toward high-volume, low-difficulty tasks
      - Recommend conducting interviews to understand reasons for non-participation
      - Consider re-evaluating quality assessments after full-text review for accuracy

      **Lucas Linard** shared parallel experience from Banco do Brasil's similar recognition system using coins/points and suggested using team grouping within contracts to prevent ranking disadvantages for small projects.

      **Arthur Martins** questioned governance of incentives and how constraints work in client-managed contracts (different from Bruno's management context).

      **Prof. Sérgio** praised Bruno's maturity in reporting both successful and unsuccessful indicators, noting this demonstrates research rigor and readiness for dissertation defense.

      #### Next steps and future work

      - Complete IMI questionnaire collection (September, October, November 2025)
      - Finalize data analysis and validation
      - Document findings on effectiveness of specific techniques
      - Address adoption barriers through root cause analysis
      - Scale implementation to other contracts with refined design (addressing complexity scoring, team grouping for fairness)
      - Publish results in academic venues
      - Complete dissertation and defend qualification

      #### Key insights

      The research demonstrates that gamification can improve operational metrics and behavioral engagement in professional settings without requiring major system overhauls. However, cultural factors and perception of "extra effort" remain barriers to adoption of certain mechanics. Success depends on aligning techniques with existing workflows and deeply understanding contextual motivational drivers—critical lessons for broader implementation across the company's eight contracts.

      ### Orc’estra presents itself as a pioneer in gamification in Brazil

      In the September 4 meeting, the junior company Orc’estra, linked to UnB Gama’s Software Engineering program, presented its trajectory and activity as the first Brazilian student organization dedicated exclusively to gamification — within the Gamificação.ORG meeting.

      Student Bryan Leite, representing the organization, emphasized that the group’s mission is to “reframe people’s lives by bringing productivity and pleasure together.” Orc’estra focuses on developing solutions that apply game techniques to foster engagement and results in different contexts.

      #### Service portfolio

      - Gamification design — needs assessment and tailored solutions.
      - Software conception — requirements structuring and high‑fidelity prototype development.
      - Gamified development — building or maintaining systems with gamification elements.

      Among the success cases are projects with Unimed (promoting healthy habits); the “Ao Encontro” app, which helps search for lost animals; and Alegro, an international marketplace aiming to strengthen users’ sense of belonging.

      #### Structure and organizational culture

      The company is organized with two presidencies (institutional and organizational) and four directorates: Communication and Marketing (Decom), Projects, Business (Debis), and Operations (Tops).

      Members describe the internal culture as collaborative and family‑like. There are practices for activity follow‑up, climate surveys, and overload prevention. “Orc’estra is not just a junior company; it’s a family,” Bryan said.

      #### Relationship with the community

      New members are selected through periodic processes announced on social networks such as Instagram and LinkedIn. Although registered with a CNPJ, Orc’estra is non‑profit: all revenue is reinvested in its own operation.

      At the end of the presentation, professors and peers highlighted Orc’estra’s relevance as a space for practical and entrepreneurial training within UnB — in the scope of the Gamificação.ORG meeting.

      ### SuperR: a gamified course comes to life at UnB

      In the June 22, 2025 meeting, professor George presented the SuperR project, an initiative that combines gamification and project‑based learning (PBL) in the Software Requirements course at the University of Brasília — within the Gamificação.ORG meeting.

      According to the instructor, the proposal originated in 2023 from student motivation indicators and retrospective analyses applied across different cohorts. The goal was to face recurring challenges — dropout, failures, and engagement difficulties — by offering a more interactive and personalized experience.

      #### How SuperR works

      The strategy was tested with two classes: one with traditional PBL and another combining PBL and gamification.

      Fictional narratives were created in a galaxy named Calamo Kairelli, where students, organized into factions, carried out missions and operations tied to the course learning objectives for each unit.

      The project involved 18 operations grouped into four major missions, with in‑class dynamics.

      Elements such as avatars, badges, rewards, and an interactive galaxy map on Miro guided students through the experience.

      #### Evaluation and results

      Motivational questionnaires inspired by Octalysis were applied, along with qualitative feedback collected for each unit.

      The class with gamification showed a lower dropout rate (8%) and higher retention (91.8%), outperforming the traditional cohorts.

      Despite higher initial cognitive load, attention, satisfaction, and confidence indicators improved over the semester.

      Team performance was superior, positively impacting pass rates and final grades.

      #### Outcomes

      SuperR generated a gamification guide, its own visual identity, badges, and even a Power Apps prototype to support activities. The project also inspired undergraduate theses and opened paths for future research using data mining and machine learning to predict motivational profiles and adapt dynamics in real time — within the Gamificação.ORG meeting.

      ### Canal Ciência bets on gamification to engage youth

      On June 5, 2025, researcher Leda Sampson, from the Brazilian Institute of Information in Science and Technology (IBICT), presented to the Gamificação.ORG group the transformation of Canal Ciência — a traditional science outreach portal created in 2002 — into a gamified environment.

      According to Leda, the portal was born to bring Brazilian science closer to society, especially students and teachers. Over time, long texts no longer resonated with newer generations. This led to the creation of educational games (puzzles, quizzes, memory games) and, more recently, a broader gamification approach.

      #### The Galactic Journey

      With support from UnB researchers, Canal Ciência launched the “Galactic Journey”, a narrative that turns visitors into space explorers in search of knowledge.

      The experience includes missions, ranks, medals, and digital rewards. The first mission, already available, takes the user from Earth to the Space Station; the second, in development, will reach the Moon. The goal is for learning to happen naturally, embedded in challenges and stories connected to the portal’s existing scientific content.

      #### Creation process

      To structure the gamification, the team used the Octalysis framework, applying three audience‑diagnosis strategies:

      - Internal discussions with subject‑matter experts (the “judges” step);
      - Questionnaires applied directly in schools;
      - Forms available on the portal itself.

      The collected data enabled mapping users’ motivational profiles and designing mechanics suitable for a mostly young audience.

      #### Results and outlook

      The project brought visibility to IBICT, yielded papers in international venues, and already inspires new initiatives. Despite resource constraints, the team plans to expand the journey to Pluto, completing all planned missions.

      For Leda, the differentiator lies in uniting innovation, science, and entertainment: “Science outreach must be fun. When users dive into an engaging narrative, they learn without realizing they are studying.”

      ### Banco do Brasil bets on gamification to engage employees

      On May 22, 2025, representatives from Banco do Brasil presented to the Gamificação.ORG group the institution’s initiatives using gamification for internal training and engagement.

      #### Strategy and goals

      Banco do Brasil has used game mechanics to make corporate learning more appealing and to encourage employee participation. The premise is that playful experiences can reinforce learning, improve content retention, and increase engagement in strategic programs.

      #### Initiatives presented

      - Gamified learning paths — content organized as tracks with challenges, rewards, and immediate feedback;
      - Friendly competition — leaderboards and team missions to foster collaboration and performance;
      - Digital recognition — medals, points, and badges awarded according to participant progress.

      #### Results observed

      According to the presenters, gamification led to higher adherence to trainings, lower dropout rates in internal courses, and positive reports on motivation and engagement. Qualitative results suggest that combining competition and collaboration can transform the organization’s learning culture.

      #### Next steps

      The institution plans to expand the use of gamification in different areas, exploring new narratives and game dynamics. The goal is to integrate learning further into daily work routines, aligning training with the strategic challenges of the financial sector.

      ### Prof. Sergio Freitas — past, present, and future of gamification

      In the Gamificação.ORG meeting, Prof. Sergio Freitas — project coordinator and head of the CEDIS gamification area — presented an in‑depth analysis of the field’s past, present, and future.

      He noted that the term “gamification” emerged in 2002, but gained academic relevance in 2011 after Sebastian Deterding’s paper. Since then, practice spread across companies and universities with varied, yet often positive, results. According to Freitas, early success was driven by intuitive uses of game techniques anchored in age‑old psychological patterns — rewards and punishments — long present in social life and studied by behaviorism.

      #### Early simplifications

      Many initial applications were simplified setups (“hard rock gamification”) based only on points, badges, and leaderboards (PBL). While effective short‑term, these designs showed limits to sustaining motivation.

      #### The 2015 shift: Octalysis

      A turning point came in 2015 with Yu‑kai Chou’s Octalysis Framework, which systematized links between game mechanics and psychological theories — especially behaviorism and Self‑Determination Theory.

      #### Frameworks and rigor

      Freitas noted that only around 3% of papers published up to 2023 explicitly used structured frameworks. Even so, tools like Octalysis, Hexad, and Bartle underscored the importance of more systematic processes to design consistent gamification.

      He emphasized Brazil’s role as a major international hub, with highlights in education and software engineering research.

      #### Future challenges

      - Persistence — ensure designs sustain motivation over time.
      - Indicators — develop stronger metrics to assess motivational and organizational impact.
      - Popularization — democratize access so everyday users can craft and apply techniques in daily life.

      In closing, Freitas reinforced that gamification should be understood as a strategy to motivate people, and that progress depends on integrating psychology, technology, and data analysis.

      ### Research by Denniel highlights paths for gamification in agile development

      On April 3, 2025, student Denniel William Roriz Lima presented his undergraduate thesis to the Gamificação.ORG group, focused on applying gamification in agile software development processes.

      #### Context and problem

      Agile methods arose to counter the rigidity of traditional models, offering flexibility and faster delivery. Yet, motivation and engagement challenges persist even within agile. Gamification emerges as an alternative, though empirical studies remain scarce and adoption in software engineering is limited.

      #### Research objectives

      The project aims to define guidelines for using gamification in agile processes, with specific goals to:

      - Identify challenges and tested solutions;
      - Map evaluation metrics;
      - Systematize practices as a guide for practitioners.

      #### Theoretical basis

      The review spans agile methodologies (XP, Scrum, FDD, Lean) and gamification frameworks, notably:

      - Hexad — player‑type profiling (philanthropists, socializers, achievers, etc.);
      - 6D Framework — six steps to implement gamification;
      - Octalysis — eight core drives balancing intrinsic/extrinsic, white/black hat motivations.

      #### Preliminary results

      - 114 Scopus papers analyzed, with co‑authorship and keyword mapping;
      - Scrum was the only agile method to form its “own node”, signaling higher relevance;
      - Recurring association between gamification, motivation, and practices like prototyping and testing;
      - Temporal analysis shows recent growth in publications and renewed interest.

      #### Next steps

      - Expand the review to other databases (ACM, IEEE);
      - Conduct practitioner interviews;
      - Draft a practical guide for applying gamification in agile development.

      #### Reception

      Faculty and peers praised the dense literature review and clarity of preliminary results, while suggesting caution about relying on a single database and encouraging continuation at the master’s level. Prof. Sergio Freitas noted that a structured guide already represents a relevant contribution to the field.

      ### Embrapa case: gamification in asset management shows advances

      On January 30, 2025, researcher Luciana Assis presented results from her master's research, advised by Prof. Sergio Freitas, on using gamification in organizational environments, with a case study at Embrapa.

      #### Context and objectives

      The work focused on GSteck, Embrapa’s research asset management system, where low user motivation had been observed. The study asked how gamification could improve engagement and collaboration, and what effects might emerge in this context.

      #### Methodology

      - Literature review: 144 papers analyzed, 36 selected — leading to an HCII (2023) publication;
      - Case study in three stages:
        - Motivational profiling (Octalysis core drives);
        - Gamification design (16 requirements);
        - Partial implementation (9 techniques: progress bars, badges, points, leaderboards, social trophies, narratives, etc.).

      #### Results

      - 135 respondents out of 780 users, representing all Embrapa units;
      - Most relevant core drive: Development & Accomplishment;
      - Implemented techniques yielded perceived increases in motivation and appreciation of the system;
      - Feedback indicated greater sense of usefulness and engagement, with suggestions to refine the evaluation model.

      #### Limitations

      - 9/16 techniques implemented due to time constraints;
      - The underlying asset‑scoring model is not yet validated by Embrapa, preventing production rollout;
      - Evaluation was conducted in a staging environment with 27 participants selected by managers.

      #### Next steps

      The group discussed standardizing a motivational‑profile questionnaire for Gamificação.ORG, based on Luciana’s instrument, and suggested submitting papers to journals such as Revista Design e Tecnologia (UFRGS), exploring methods and findings.

      ### Gamification in the Military Police: potential and challenges

      On January 16, 2025, Capt. Públio Cavalcante (Military Police) presented a study on using gamification in police intelligence reports.

      #### Objective and method

      The study assessed whether gamification could improve the quality of intelligence reports. It applied Intrinsic Motivation Inventory (IMI), Octalysis‑based motivational profiling, and a comparison between units using or not a gamified reporting system.

      #### Implementation

      The Ippon Web system was adapted with medals, leaderboards, virtual coins, and anonymous peer feedback. Each report was evaluated by three different people; scores fed individual and team profiles. Techniques included social reinforcement, immediate feedback, and achievement progression.

      #### Results and perceptions

      - Intangible: higher engagement from officers as they felt read and evaluated; rare peer feedback in the military environment improved text and image quality.
      - Quantitative: independent evaluations showed slightly higher scores for gamified reports.
      - Limitations: only 6/19 planned techniques implemented; short pilot window constrained robust effects.

      #### Institutional challenges

      Command changes led to pausing gamification, prioritizing administrative use of the system. Cultural and institutional maturity are needed to sustain such innovations.

      #### Conclusion

      Gamification can engage agents and improve intelligence reporting, but faces constraints of time, culture, and continuity. Prof. Sergio Freitas highlighted intangible gains — especially feedback and professional appreciation — as central to gamification and worth deeper research.

      ### Researchers discuss motivational profiling and gamification in Canal Ciência

      On December 19, 2024, Prof. Cristiane Soares Ramos and undergraduate student Mylena Angélica Silva Farias presented the paper “Process for players: a motivational profile for designing a gamification project” — an award‑winning work at an international congress in Hanoi — to the Gamificação.ORG group.

      #### Study focus

      The research investigated how to map motivational profiles to make gamification projects more effective. The context was Canal Ciência (IBICT), a science outreach portal for students and teachers. The audience heterogeneity (children to adults) required multiple diagnostic strategies.

      #### Three strategies

      - Expert assessment: judges analyzed motivational profiles using Octalysis;
      - In‑person dynamics: games like “The problem in my school/city” and “My other half is with you” applied in classrooms;
      - Adapted questionnaires: forms for children, teens, and adults, based on the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory.

      Results highlighted social influence, unpredictability, and creative empowerment as key drives to engage the audience.

      #### From theory to practice

      The mapping led to the “Galactic Journey” narrative, turning visitors into space explorers. The first mission, already launched, addresses environmental disasters (floods, wildfires). The next, in development, takes users to the International Space Station.

      #### Monitoring and outlook

      Impact is being tracked with Google Analytics and internal performance metrics (ranks, medals, mission progression). Despite initial increases in access and retention, the researchers caution it is too early to assert causality.

      The study opens paths for future research and reinforces integrating motivational diagnostics with business metrics — also echoed in partnerships with organizations such as Banco do Brasil.

      ### Gamification proposal for software project management

      On December 5, 2024, Gamificação.ORG hosted Bruno Mello Andrade, who presented his research proposal for a qualification in the Graduate Program in Applied Computing. The focus is to apply gamification to software project management processes, especially in software factories operating in the public sector.

      #### Motivation challenge

      Drawing from experience in a software factory with public contracts, Bruno noted that professional motivation often narrows to financial incentives. The proposal explores gamification to engage managers and teams beyond money, defining objective criteria for bonus distribution and fostering healthy competition across projects.

      #### Game structure (on Jira)

      Built on Jira, widely used by the company:

      - Each manager “owns” a project and creates a customizable character;
      - Planning, scope updates, and adequate Jira usage award points and badges;
      - Indicators include finished tasks, updated backlog, team communication, and client evaluation;
      - Accumulated score multiplies existing bonuses, adding a playful layer to the rewards system.

      #### Evaluation and indicators

      The model combines productivity metrics (completed tasks, execution time, open defects) and motivational metrics (team satisfaction, engagement, collaboration). Assessment compares before/after gamification using the GQM method (Goal–Question–Metric) to align business goals, research questions, and metrics.

      #### Critiques and suggestions

      - Cristiane Soares Ramos: strengthen alignment between indicators and GQM; beware of reducing everything to money;
      - Luciana Assis: broaden the repertoire of game mechanics (collaboration, motivational profiles) to prevent excessive competition;
      - Davi Rocha: leverage the Hexad model to map individual motivations and tailor techniques to team profiles.

      #### Outlook

      Bruno acknowledged sustainability and team‑engagement challenges and the need to balance extrinsic (bonuses) and intrinsic (recognition, collaboration) motivations. The proposal should evolve on rules, indicators, and theming, but already stands as a promising case study for gamification in software engineering.

      ### Revisão Sistemática de Literatura sobre Gamificação para Melhoria de Qualidade de Software

      Em 24 de outubro de 2025, Lucas Pereira Gomes Linard apresentou a metodologia e progresso de sua revisão sistemática de literatura (RSL) de mestrado sobre gamificação aplicada à qualidade no desenvolvimento de software. Sua pesquisa investiga como gamificação pode estimular desenvolvedores a escrever código de melhor qualidade no Banco do Brasil.

      #### Motivação e contexto da pesquisa

      Lucas trabalha como programador na área de Qualidade de Software do Banco do Brasil. Através de observação empírica validada academicamente com o Professor Sérgio, ele identificou um comportamento crítico: desenvolvedores melhoram a qualidade do código apenas até o ponto em que não precisam de aprovação do chefe. Além desse limiar, as melhorias de qualidade estagnam, independentemente da severidade dos problemas.

      A pesquisa investiga se técnicas de gamificação podem superar essa barreira de motivação e incentivar desenvolvedores a melhorar proativamente a qualidade do código, especialmente no tratamento de dívida técnica acumulada.

      #### Metodologia da Revisão Sistemática de Literatura

      Lucas compartilhou seu fluxo de trabalho prático para condução da RSL:

      - **Protocolo e planejamento**: Desenvolvimento de checklist de avaliação de qualidade e critérios de seleção de estudos
      - **Busca e seleção de estudos**: Busca em múltiplas bases de dados, recuperando 1.324 artigos no total (1.293 não duplicados), com 1.149 rejeitados no nível título/resumo e 82 aceitos para leitura completa
      - **Extração e organização de dados**: Repositório privado com armazenamento de PDFs, sincronização automatizada de bibliografia e formulários de extração padronizados
      - **Avaliação de qualidade**: Estudos avaliados com base em resumo e título na triagem inicial; planos para reavaliação após leitura completa
      - **Técnica de snowballing**: Identificação de referências relevantes de estudos inclusos com marcação estruturada (amarelo = anotações gerais, verde = aspectos de gamificação, azul = métricas relevantes, vermelho = erros/discordâncias)
      - **Aproveitamento de IA/LLMs**: Uso de ferramentas como Claude para organizar dados extraídos, buscar em 10+ artigos iniciais e identificar padrões ligando achados de pesquisa à proposta de gamificação

      #### Principais achados da pesquisa até o momento

      Entre os 11 primeiros artigos analisados:

      - **Técnicas de gamificação identificadas**: Diversas técnicas incluindo placar de pontuação (leaderboards), rankings, crachás (badges) e incentivos para tarefas específicas
      - **Métricas utilizadas**: Métricas de análise estática de código (violações SonarQube), densidade de vulnerabilidades, cobertura de testes, conformidade com padrões e medições de dívida técnica
      - **Definição de qualidade**: A pesquisa padroniza "qualidade" focando em violações de regras de análise estática SonarQube, pois são diretamente acionáveis por desenvolvedores e mensuráveis. Isso se alinha com a estrutura de qualidade atual do Banco do Brasil usando regras SonarQube padrão
      - **Preocupações com lead time**: Apesar de ser uma questão de pesquisa fundamental, Lucas encontrou mínima evidência em literatura sobre o impacto de gamificação no tempo de desenvolvimento. Essa permanece como uma lacuna aberta — uma preocupação expressa por stakeholders de negócio: melhorar qualidade de código aumenta tempo de deploy, anulando valor de negócio?

      #### Direção da proposta de pesquisa

      Os achados da RSL informam o design da proposta de gamificação de Lucas para Banco do Brasil. Recursos planejados incluem:

      - **Missões de refatoração**: Missões gamificadas para reduzir complexidade de código ou tratar dívida técnica sem exigir entrega de nova feature (ex: "Reduza a complexidade deste método de 8 para 5 e ganhe 5 moedas")
      - **Seleção de técnicas baseada em evidências**: Uso de achados da RSL para escolher mecânicas de gamificação com efetividade documentada em contextos similares
      - **Adaptação específica de contexto**: Aplicação de gamificação a melhorias de qualidade mantendo foco de negócio em lead time e cronogramas de entrega
      - **Análise por simulação**: Lucas previamente conduziu simulações Monte Carlo mostrando que 2 horas por sprint por desenvolvedor dedicadas a redução de dívida técnica poderiam melhorar significativamente a saúde do código sem perda major de produtividade

      #### Estratégia de organização da pesquisa

      Lucas demonstrou como organiza dados extraídos para mapear evidências de pesquisa à sua proposta:

      - **Fonte única de verdade**: Toda extração de dados centralizada em formato de repositório para consistência e processamento com LLMs
      - **Mapeamento de evidências**: Ligação de cada questão de pesquisa a artigos específicos e seus achados (ex: artigos S2, S3, S5, S8, S11 abordam "Quais técnicas de gamificação são usadas?")
      - **Normalização de conceitos**: Planejamento de padronizar termos sinônimos entre papers (ex: "leaderboard" vs. "ranking") para obter visão abrangente de uso de técnicas
      - **Resumos em slides para orientador**: Cada artigo recebe resumo de uma página (em GammaApp) documentando lógica de inclusão/exclusão e relação com questões de pesquisa

      #### Feedback da comunidade

      - **Professora Cristiane**: Enfatizou importância de questões de pesquisa claras e como evidências extraídas as respondem; sugeriu manter fonte única e autoritária para extração de dados
      - **Luciana**: Ressaltou desafio de encontrar evidências sobre lead time em literatura; recomendou ampliar busca a literatura geral de qualidade de software e manutenção para capturar evidências indiretas de economia de tempo
      - **Bruno**: Destacou importância de definir claramente "qualidade" para escopiar o trabalho; elogiou a padronização de regras SonarQube como benchmark de qualidade
      - **Sergio**: Congratulou Lucas pela apresentação rica e encorajou conclusão da RSL, desenvolvimento da proposta e fases de qualificação

      #### Próximos passos

      - Completar a revisão sistemática de literatura (atualmente lendo 82 artigos selecionados; resultados iniciais disponíveis dos 11 primeiros)
      - Normalizar terminologia em dados extraídos
      - Finalizar mapeamento de evidências ligando achados da RSL ao design da proposta de gamificação
      - Desenvolver e testar proposta de gamificação com equipes de desenvolvimento do Banco do Brasil
      - Medir tanto melhorias de qualidade quanto impacto em lead time para validar viabilidade de negócio

      A pesquisa demonstra metodologia acadêmica rigorosa aplicada a desafio real de engenharia de software, combinando evidências de literatura com contexto prático de indústria para informar inovação em motivação de desenvolvedores e qualidade de código.

      ### Gamificação em Gestão de Projetos de Software: Implementação e Resultados

      Em 3 de outubro de 2025, Bruno Mello Andrade apresentou resultados parciais de sua dissertação de mestrado à comunidade Gamificação.ORG. O trabalho aborda gamificação aplicada a equipes de gestão de TI em contexto de fábrica de software, avaliando impacto no engajamento e produtividade.

      #### Contexto e motivação da pesquisa

      Bruno atua na gestão de operações de uma fábrica de software em Brasília com mais de 8 contratos para o setor público (recentemente incluindo Caixa Econômica). A empresa enfrenta desafios típicos do setor: contratos adjudicados ao menor preço, limitações de motivação de pessoal além de aumentos salariais, e necessidade de manter produtividade e qualidade de código sob pressões competitivas.

      A pesquisa investiga se técnicas de gamificação podem superar barreiras motivacionais em desenvolvimento profissional de software, focando inicialmente na camada de gestão para criar efeito cascata em direção às equipes de desenvolvimento.

      #### Metodologia da pesquisa

      **Cronograma de atividades:**
      - Revisão de literatura sobre gamificação
      - Proposta de pesquisa e defesa de qualificação
      - Pesquisa de engajamento de equipe (questionário IMI) com 12 respostas de gestores nas 7 subescalas motivacionais
      - Mapeamento de técnicas de gamificação usando o modelo Hexad de motivações de jogadores
      - Implementação de gamificação em contrato Telebrás (piloto)
      - Coleta de dados e análise em andamento (setembro-novembro 2025)

      #### Estratégia de implementação da gamificação

      Bruno implementou gamificação integrada em ferramentas existentes (Jira para gestão de tarefas; Confluence para documentação) sem exigir sistemas adicionais, assegurando viabilidade de adoção.

      **Técnicas de gamificação aplicadas:**

      1. **Narrativa** (Core Épico – Valor de Utilidade): Construída uma história do projeto usando documentação de histórias de usuários, estabelecendo regras do jogo, conquistas e mural de reconhecimento.

      2. **Almoço Grátis** (Core Empoderamento & Criatividade): Mecanismo de reconhecimento espontâneo de colegas em mural no Confluence, com diretrizes claras para reconhecimento.

      3. **Elitismo** (Core Empoderamento & Criatividade): Ranking visual de integrantes com maiores fechamentos de tarefas por sprint, reconhecidos com badges.

      4. **Herói da Humanidade** (Core Empoderamento & Criatividade): Badge de reconhecimento para indivíduos com mais feedback de colegas.

      5. **Céu de Brigadeiro** (Core Realização): Dashboard exibindo progresso de sprint, status de tarefas (abertas, em desenvolvimento, concluídas) e métricas de backlog com feedback visual.

      6. **Controle em Tempo Real** (Core Realização): Visualização gráfica do progresso de fechamento de tarefas e indicadores de saúde de sprint.

      7. **Conquistas (Badges)** (Core Pertencimento & Social): 6 badges distintas conquistadas por:
         - Completar 2+ sprints por mês
         - Manter taxa de erros abaixo de 5%
         - Atingir resultados operacionais planejados
         - Avaliações de satisfação de cliente ≥ 8
         - 2+ anos de tempo na empresa
         - Zero glosa (badge premium)

      8. **Missões Especiais** (Core Pertencimento & Social): Tarefas gamificadas fora do fluxo diário (ex: melhorias de processo, atualizações de documentação, manutenção de tarefas) que contribuem à saúde da empresa e redução de dívida técnica.

      **Sistema de avaliação e recompensa:**
      - Avaliação quinzenal: 80%+ fechamento de sprint = 1 ponto; 60%+ conclusão de backlog = 1 ponto
      - Avaliação mensal: 3+ reconhecimentos de colegas = 1 ponto; conclusão de missão = 1 ponto; badges conquistadas = 1 ponto por badge
      - Métricas de qualidade: Máx 10% itens de defeito por sprint
      - Recompensa final: Top 3 gestores recebem 3, 2 e 1 dias de folga remunerada (definidos por ranking de pontos)

      #### Resultados e achados

      **Resultados positivos:**
      - Melhoria de qualidade de dados: menos tarefas esquecidas/não fechadas (anteriormente tarefas permaneciam por 40+ horas)
      - Melhores taxas de rastreamento e fechamento de tarefas
      - Engajamento de equipe: feedback verbal indicava satisfação ("leve, divertido, engajante")
      - Impacto institucional: empresa solicitou expansão de implementação para outros contratos
      - Maior conscientização de rastreamento de processo e produtividade (importante para avaliações de maturidade CMM-I)

      **Desafios e limitações:**
      - Mecanismos de reconhecimento (mural de feedback de colegas, missões especiais) mostram baixa adoção—resistência cultural a atividades percebidas como "trabalho extra"
      - Melhoria limitada em índices motivacionais (questionário IMI) comparado a métricas comportamentais
      - Padrões de interação entre profissionais não melhoraram visivelmente; cultura de feedback permanece fraca
      - Complexidade de tarefas não fatorada em scoring (potencial para gaming: selecionar tarefas fáceis ao invés de desafiadoras)
      - Nenhuma medição direta de impacto em motivação de equipe de engenharia (apenas camada de gestão pesquisada)
      - Coleta de dados ainda em andamento; análise final pendente

      #### Feedback da comunidade e recomendações

      **Professora Cristiane Ramos** destacou sucesso de manter gamificação alinhada a fluxos de trabalho diários existentes ao invés de introduzir passos extras. Observações chave:
      - Mural de reconhecimento e missões especiais divergem de práticas diárias; considere análise de causa raiz para baixa adoção
      - Sugira incorporar complexidade de tarefas/story points em scoring para prevenir viés em tarefas de alto volume, baixa dificuldade
      - Recomende realizar entrevistas para entender razões de não participação
      - Considere reavaliar assessments de qualidade após revisão completa para precisão

      **Lucas Linard** compartilhou experiência paralela do Banco do Brasil com sistema similar de reconhecimento usando moedas/pontos e sugeriu usar agrupamento de equipes dentro de contratos para prevenir desvantagens de ranking em projetos pequenos.

      **Arthur Martins** questionou governança de incentivos e como restrições funcionam em contratos com gestão de cliente (diferente do contexto de gestão de Bruno).

      **Professor Sérgio** elogiou maturidade de Bruno em reportar indicadores bem-sucedidos e mal-sucedidos, observando que isso demonstra rigor de pesquisa e prontidão para defesa de dissertação.

      #### Próximos passos e trabalho futuro

      - Completar coleta de questionário IMI (setembro, outubro, novembro 2025)
      - Finalizar análise de dados e validação
      - Documentar achados sobre efetividade de técnicas específicas
      - Endereçar barreiras de adoção através de análise de causa raiz
      - Escalar implementação para outros contratos com design refinado (endereçando scoring de complexidade, agrupamento de equipes para justiça)
      - Publicar resultados em venues acadêmicas
      - Completar dissertação e defender qualificação

      #### Insights principais

      A pesquisa demonstra que gamificação pode melhorar métricas operacionais e engajamento comportamental em ambientes profissionais sem exigir reformulações maiores de sistemas. Contudo, fatores culturais e percepção de "esforço extra" permanecem como barreiras à adoção de certos mecanismos. O sucesso depende de alinhar técnicas com fluxos de trabalho existentes e compreender profundamente drivers motivacionais contextuais—lições críticas para implementação mais ampla nos oito contratos da empresa.

      ### Orc’estra se apresenta como pioneira em gamificação no Brasil

      Na reunião de 4 de setembro, a empresa júnior Orc’estra, vinculada ao curso de Engenharia de Software da UnB Gama, apresentou sua trajetória e atuação como a primeira organização estudantil brasileira dedicada exclusivamente à gamificação — no âmbito da Reunião Gamificação.ORG.

      O estudante Bryan Leite, representante da entidade, ressaltou que a missão do grupo é “ressignificar a vida das pessoas, unindo produtividade e prazer”. A Orc’estra tem como foco o desenvolvimento de soluções que aplicam técnicas de jogos para estimular engajamento e resultados em diferentes contextos.

      #### Portfólio de serviços

      - Design de gamificação — diagnóstico de necessidades e elaboração de soluções personalizadas.
      - Concepção de software — estruturação de requisitos e desenvolvimento de protótipos de alta fidelidade.
      - Desenvolvimento gamificado — criação ou manutenção de sistemas com elementos de gamificação.

      Entre os cases de sucesso, destacam‑se projetos com a Unimed, voltados à promoção de hábitos de saúde; o aplicativo Ao Encontro, que auxilia na busca de animais perdidos; e o Alegro, marketplace internacional que buscou aumentar o senso de pertencimento dos usuários.

      #### Estrutura e cultura organizacional

      A empresa é organizada em duas presidências (institucional e organizacional) e quatro diretorias: Comunicação e Marketing (Decom), Projetos, Negócios (Debis) e Operações (Tops).

      A cultura interna é descrita pelos membros como colaborativa e familiar. Há práticas de acompanhamento de atividades, pesquisas de clima e prevenção de sobrecarga. “A Orc’estra não é só uma empresa júnior, é uma família”, afirmou Bryan.

      #### Relação com a comunidade

      A seleção de novos integrantes ocorre em processos seletivos periódicos, divulgados em redes sociais como Instagram e LinkedIn. Embora registrada com CNPJ, a Orc’estra não tem fins lucrativos: toda receita é reinvestida na própria operação.

      Ao final da apresentação, professores e colegas destacaram a relevância da Orc’estra como espaço de formação prática e empreendedora dentro da UnB — no contexto da Reunião Gamificação.ORG.

      ### SuperR: disciplina gamificada ganha vida na UnB

      Na reunião de 22 de junho de 2025, o professor George apresentou o projeto SuperR, iniciativa que combina gamificação e aprendizagem baseada em projetos (PBL) na disciplina de Requisitos de Software da Universidade de Brasília — no contexto da Reunião Gamificação.ORG.

      Segundo o docente, a proposta nasceu em 2023 a partir de indicadores de motivação estudantil e de análises retrospectivas aplicadas em diferentes turmas. O objetivo era enfrentar desafios recorrentes — evasão, reprovação e dificuldades de engajamento —, oferecendo uma experiência mais interativa e personalizada.

      #### Como funciona o SuperR

      A estratégia foi testada em duas turmas: uma com PBL tradicional e outra com a combinação de PBL e gamificação.

      Foram criadas narrativas ficcionais ambientadas em uma galáxia chamada Calamo Kairelli, onde estudantes organizados em facções cumpriam missões e operações vinculadas aos objetivos acadêmicos de cada unidade da disciplina.

      O projeto envolveu 18 operações distribuídas em quatro grandes missões, com dinâmicas presenciais em sala de aula.

      Elementos como avatares, emblemas, recompensas e um mapa galáctico interativo no Miro ajudaram a guiar os alunos pela experiência.

      #### Avaliação e resultados

      Foram aplicados questionários motivacionais inspirados no Octalysis, além de feedbacks qualitativos coletados a cada unidade.

      A turma que recebeu a gamificação apresentou menor taxa de desistência (8%) e maior taxa de retenção (91,8%), superando as turmas tradicionais.

      Apesar de uma carga cognitiva maior no início, os índices de atenção, satisfação e confiança melhoraram ao longo do semestre.

      O desempenho em equipe foi superior, com impacto positivo também nas taxas de aprovação e nas notas finais.

      #### Desdobramentos

      O SuperR gerou um guia de gamificação, identidade visual própria, emblemas e até um protótipo de aplicativo em Power Apps para apoiar as atividades. O projeto também inspirou trabalhos de TCC e abriu caminho para futuras pesquisas envolvendo mineração de dados e machine learning para prever perfis motivacionais e ajustar as dinâmicas em tempo real — no âmbito da Reunião Gamificação.ORG.

      ### Canal Ciência aposta em gamificação para engajar jovens

      No dia 5 de junho de 2025, a pesquisadora Leda Sampson, do Instituto Brasileiro de Informação em Ciência e Tecnologia (IBICT), apresentou ao grupo Gamificação.ORG a experiência de transformação do Canal Ciência, tradicional portal de divulgação científica criado em 2002, em um ambiente gamificado.

      Segundo Leda, o portal nasceu para aproximar a ciência brasileira da população, especialmente estudantes e professores. Com o tempo, percebeu‑se que textos longos já não dialogavam com as novas gerações. Foi nesse contexto que surgiram os jogos educativos (quebra‑cabeças, quizzes, jogos da memória) e, mais recentemente, a ideia de gamificação.

      #### A jornada galáctica

      Com apoio de pesquisadores da UnB, o Canal Ciência lançou a “Jornada Galáctica”, uma narrativa que transforma o visitante em explorador espacial em busca de conhecimento.

      A experiência envolve missões, patentes, medalhas e recompensas digitais. A primeira missão, já disponível, leva o usuário da Terra até a Estação Espacial; a segunda, em desenvolvimento, chegará à Lua. O objetivo é que o aprendizado aconteça de forma natural, inserido em desafios e histórias que se conectam ao conteúdo científico já existente no portal.

      #### Processo de criação

      Para estruturar a gamificação, a equipe utilizou o framework Octalysis, aplicando três estratégias de diagnóstico do público:

      - Discussões internas com especialistas (etapa dos “juízes”);
      - Questionários aplicados diretamente em escolas;

      - Formulários disponíveis no próprio portal.

      Esses dados permitiram traçar perfis motivacionais dos usuários e desenhar mecânicas adequadas ao público‑alvo — majoritariamente juvenil.

      #### Resultados e perspectivas

      O projeto trouxe visibilidade ao IBICT, rendeu artigos publicados em eventos internacionais e já inspira novas iniciativas. Apesar das limitações de recursos, a equipe pretende expandir a jornada até Plutão, concluindo todas as missões planejadas.

      Para Leda, o diferencial está em unir inovação, ciência e entretenimento: “A divulgação científica precisa ser divertida. Quando o usuário mergulha em uma narrativa envolvente, ele aprende sem perceber que está estudando”.

      ### Palestra do Prof. Sergio Freitas — 08/05/2025

      Na reunião do Gamificação.ORG, o professor Sergio Freitas, coordenador do projeto e também da área de gamificação do CEDIS, apresentou uma análise aprofundada sobre o passado, o presente e o futuro da gamificação.

      Ele destacou que o termo surgiu em 2002, mas ganhou relevância acadêmica em 2011, após o artigo de Sebastian Deterding. A partir daí, a prática se difundiu tanto em empresas quanto em universidades, com resultados variados, mas quase sempre positivos. Segundo Freitas, esse êxito inicial deveu‑se ao uso intuitivo de técnicas de jogos ancoradas em padrões psicológicos milenares, como recompensas e punições, já presentes na vida social e estudados pelo behaviorismo.

      #### Montagens iniciais simplificadas

      No entanto, ele alertou que muitas aplicações iniciais foram montagens simplificadas (hard rock gamification), baseadas apenas em pontos, medalhas e rankings (PBL). Isso funcionava no curto prazo, mas revelava limites para manter a motivação dos usuários.

      #### A virada de 2015: Octalysis

      A virada ocorreu em 2015, com a chegada do Octalysis Framework de Yu‑kai Chou, que sistematizou a relação entre mecânicas de jogo e teorias psicológicas — sobretudo o behaviorismo e a Teoria da Autodeterminação.

      #### Frameworks e rigor

      Freitas afirmou que apenas cerca de 3% dos artigos publicados até 2023 utilizavam frameworks estruturados. Mesmo assim, ferramentas como Octalysis, Hexad e Bartle mostraram a importância de processos mais sistematizados para criar gamificações consistentes.

      Ele enfatizou que o Brasil já figura como um dos grandes polos internacionais na área, com destaque para pesquisas em educação e engenharia de software.

      #### Desafios para o futuro

      - Persistência — garantir que gamificações mantenham a motivação ao longo do tempo.
      - Indicadores — desenvolver métricas mais robustas que permitam avaliar de fato o impacto motivacional e organizacional.
      - Popularização — democratizar o acesso à gamificação, capacitando também o usuário comum a criar e aplicar técnicas no cotidiano.

      Ao encerrar, Sergio reforçou que a gamificação deve ser entendida como uma estratégia para motivar pessoas, e que o avanço da área depende da integração entre psicologia, tecnologia e análise de dados.

      ### Pesquisa de Denniel aponta caminhos para gamificação no desenvolvimento ágil

      Na reunião de 3 de abril de 2025, o estudante Denniel William Roriz Lima apresentou ao grupo Gamificação.ORG seu Trabalho de Conclusão de Curso, voltado à aplicação da gamificação em processos de desenvolvimento ágil de software.

      #### Contexto e problema

      As metodologias ágeis surgiram como resposta à rigidez do modelo tradicional, oferecendo flexibilidade e entregas rápidas. No entanto, mesmo no ágil, desafios de motivação e engajamento persistem. A gamificação aparece como alternativa, embora ainda haja escassez de estudos empíricos e aplicação limitada na engenharia de software.

      #### Objetivos da pesquisa

      O projeto busca definir diretrizes para o uso da gamificação em processos ágeis, com metas como:

      - Identificar desafios e soluções já testadas;
      - Mapear métricas de avaliação;
      - Sistematizar práticas que sirvam de guia a profissionais.

      #### Base teórica

      A revisão cobre metodologias ágeis (XP, Scrum, FDD, Lean) e frameworks de gamificação, entre eles:

      - Hexad — classificação de perfis de jogadores (filantropos, socializadores, conquistadores etc.);
      - Framework 6D — seis passos para implementar gamificação;
      - Octalysis — oito motores de motivação, equilibrando dimensões intrínsecas/extrínsecas e “chapéu branco/chapéu preto”.

      #### Resultados preliminares

      - 114 artigos da base Scopus analisados, com mapeamento de coautoria e palavras‑chave;
      - Scrum foi a única metodologia a formar “nó próprio”, indicando maior relevância nos estudos;
      - Associação recorrente entre gamificação, motivação e práticas como prototipagem e testes de software;
      - Análise temporal mostra aumento recente de publicações e interesse renovado no tema.

      #### Próximos passos

      - Expandir a revisão para ACM e IEEE;
      - Conduzir entrevistas com profissionais;
      - Elaborar um guia prático para orientar a aplicação de gamificação em desenvolvimento ágil.

      #### Repercussão

      Professores e colegas elogiaram a densidade da revisão e a clareza dos resultados preliminares, sugerindo cautela quanto ao uso de uma única base e incentivando continuidade no mestrado. O professor Sergio Freitas lembrou que a criação de um guia sistemático já representa contribuição relevante para a área.

      ### Pesquisa da Embrapa aplica gamificação em gestão de ativos e aponta avanços

      Na reunião de 30 de janeiro de 2025, a pesquisadora Luciana Assis apresentou os resultados de seu mestrado, orientado pelo professor Sergio Freitas, sobre o uso de gamificação em ambientes organizacionais, com estudo de caso na Embrapa.

      #### Contexto e objetivos

      O trabalho foi realizado no sistema GSteck, responsável pela gestão de ativos de pesquisa da Embrapa, onde se observava baixa motivação de uso. A pesquisa buscou responder como soluções de gamificação poderiam melhorar engajamento e colaboração, e quais efeitos poderiam surgir nesse contexto.

      #### Metodologia

      - Revisão da literatura: 144 artigos analisados, 36 selecionados — resultando em publicação no periódico HCII (2023);
      - Estudo de caso em três etapas:
        - Identificação do perfil motivacional (core drivers do Octalysis);
        - Projeto da solução (16 requisitos);
        - Implementação parcial (9 técnicas: barras de progresso, selos, pontos, rankings, troféus sociais, narrativas etc.).

      #### Resultados

      - 135 respondentes entre 780 usuários, contemplando todas as unidades da Embrapa;
      - Core driver mais relevante: Desenvolvimento e Realização;
      - Técnicas implementadas geraram melhorias percebidas na motivação e valorização do sistema;
      - Feedbacks indicaram maior senso de utilidade e engajamento, com sugestões de aprimorar o modelo de avaliação.

      #### Limitações

      - 9 das 16 técnicas previstas foram implementadas, por restrições de tempo;
      - O modelo de pontuação de ativos ainda não foi validado pela Embrapa, impedindo implantação em produção;
      - A avaliação ocorreu em ambiente de homologação, com 27 participantes selecionados pelas gestoras.

      #### Próximos passos

      O grupo discutiu padronizar um questionário de perfis motivacionais no Gamificação.ORG, a partir do instrumento de Luciana, e sugeriu submissões a periódicos como a Revista Design e Tecnologia (UFRGS), explorando metodologias e resultados.

      ### Gamificação na Polícia Militar: estudo de caso revela potencial e desafios

      Na reunião de 16 de janeiro de 2025, o capitão Públio Cavalcante, da Polícia Militar, apresentou sua pesquisa sobre o uso de gamificação em relatórios de inteligência policial.

      #### Objetivo e metodologia

      O estudo avaliou se a gamificação poderia melhorar a qualidade de relatórios de inteligência. Foram aplicados o IMI (Inventário de Motivação Intrínseca), perfis motivacionais com base no Octalysis e comparação entre unidades com e sem a versão gamificada do sistema.

      #### Implementação

      O sistema Ippon Web foi adaptado com medalhas, rankings, moedas virtuais e feedback anônimo entre pares. Cada relatório era avaliado por três pessoas; os resultados alimentavam perfis individuais e coletivos. Técnicas incluíram reforço social, feedback imediato e progressão por conquistas.

      #### Resultados e percepções

      - Intangíveis: maior engajamento ao perceberem leitura e avaliação; feedback entre pares — raro no ambiente militar — melhorou a qualidade de textos e imagens.
      - Quantitativos: avaliações independentes indicaram notas ligeiramente superiores para relatórios gamificados.
      - Limitações: 6/19 técnicas previstas implementadas; pouco tempo de aplicação reduziu efeitos mensuráveis.

      #### Desafios institucionais

      Mudanças de comando levaram à suspensão da gamificação, priorizando uso administrativo do sistema. É necessário amadurecimento cultural e institucional para consolidar inovações desse tipo.

      #### Conclusão

      A gamificação mostrou potencial para engajar agentes e aprimorar relatórios, mas enfrenta barreiras de tempo, cultura e continuidade. O prof. Sergio Freitas destacou ganhos intangíveis — feedback e valorização profissional — como centrais na lógica da gamificação e promissores para pesquisas futuras.

      ### Pesquisadoras discutem perfil motivacional e gamificação no Canal Ciência

      Na reunião de 19 de dezembro de 2024, a professora Cristiane Soares Ramos e a estudante de graduação Mylena Angélica Silva Farias apresentaram ao grupo Gamificação.ORG o artigo “Process for players: a motivational profile for designing a gamification project”, premiado em congresso internacional em Hanói.

      #### O foco do estudo

      O trabalho investigou como mapear perfis motivacionais para tornar projetos de gamificação mais eficazes. O contexto analisado foi o Canal Ciência (IBICT), portal de divulgação científica voltado a estudantes e professores. A heterogeneidade do público — de crianças a adultos — demandou estratégias múltiplas de diagnóstico.

      #### As três estratégias apresentadas

      - Avaliação por especialistas: análise de perfis motivacionais por juízes a partir do Octalysis;
      - Dinâmicas presenciais: jogos como “Problema da minha escola/cidade” e “Minha outra metade está com você” aplicados em turmas;
      - Questionários adaptados: formulários diferenciados para crianças, jovens e adultos, baseados no Inventário de Motivação Intrínseca.

      Os resultados destacaram influência social, imprevisibilidade e empoderamento criativo como fatores determinantes para engajar o público.

      #### Da teoria à prática

      O mapeamento resultou na criação da narrativa “Jornada Galáctica”, que transforma o visitante em explorador espacial. A primeira missão, já lançada, aborda desastres ambientais (enchentes e queimadas). A próxima, em desenvolvimento, levará os usuários à Estação Espacial Internacional.

      #### Monitoramento e perspectivas

      O impacto está sendo acompanhado via Google Analytics e métricas internas (patentes, medalhas, progressão em missões). Apesar do aumento inicial de acessos e retenção, as pesquisadoras reforçaram que ainda é cedo para comprovar causalidade.

      O estudo abre caminho para futuras pesquisas e reforça a importância de integrar diagnósticos motivacionais com métricas de negócio — ponto também ressaltado em parcerias com organizações como o Banco do Brasil.

      ### Bruno apresenta proposta de gamificação em gestão de projetos de software

      No dia 5 de dezembro de 2024, o grupo Gamificação.ORG acompanhou a apresentação de Bruno Mello Andrade, que trouxe sua proposta de pesquisa para a qualificação no Programa de Pós‑Graduação em Computação Aplicada. O foco do trabalho é aplicar gamificação em processos de gestão de projetos de software, especialmente em fábricas de software que atuam no setor público.

      #### O desafio da motivação

      Com base em sua experiência em uma fábrica de software com contratos públicos, Bruno destacou que a motivação dos profissionais muitas vezes se restringe a incentivos financeiros. A proposta busca explorar a gamificação como meio de engajar gestores e equipes para além do dinheiro, criando critérios objetivos para distribuição de bônus e estimulando uma competição saudável entre projetos.

      #### Estrutura do jogo (Jira)

      O modelo se apoia no Jira, amplamente utilizado pela empresa:

      - Cada gestor assume um projeto e cria um personagem customizável;
      - Planejamento, atualização de escopo e uso adequado do Jira rendem pontos e medalhas;
      - Indicadores incluem tarefas finalizadas, backlog atualizado, comunicação com a equipe e avaliação do cliente;
      - A pontuação acumulada multiplica o bônus financeiro já previsto, criando uma camada lúdica sobre o sistema atual.

      #### Avaliação e indicadores

      O modelo prevê métricas de produtividade (tarefas concluídas, tempo de execução, defeitos abertos) e de motivação (satisfação, engajamento, colaboração). A avaliação compara antes/depois da gamificação com o método GQM (Goal‑Question‑Metric), alinhando objetivos de negócio, questões de pesquisa e métricas.

      #### Críticas e sugestões

      - Cristiane Soares Ramos: reforçar o alinhamento entre indicadores e GQM; atenção para não reduzir tudo a dinheiro;
      - Luciana Assis: ampliar as técnicas de jogo (colaboração, perfis motivacionais) para evitar competição excessiva;
      - Davi Rocha: usar o modelo Hexad para mapear motivações individuais e adaptar técnicas ao perfil da equipe.

      #### Perspectivas

      Bruno reconheceu desafios de sustentabilidade e envolvimento da equipe, além da necessidade de equilibrar motivações extrínsecas (bônus) e intrínsecas (reconhecimento, colaboração). A proposta ainda deve evoluir em regras, indicadores e tematização, mas já se mostra um estudo de caso promissor para aplicação de gamificação em engenharia de software.
