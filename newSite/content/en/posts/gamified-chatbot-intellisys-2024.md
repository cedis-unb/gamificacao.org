Brasília, September 6, 2024 — The article **“Gamified Chatbot Management Process: A way to build gamified chatbots”**, developed by **Arthur Temporim** (graduate from PPCA/UnB), was presented at **IntelliSys 2024**, held on September 5–6 in Amsterdam, Netherlands.

The work, part of his master’s dissertation defended earlier this year, describes the **Gamified Chatbot Management Process (GCMP)** — a process that integrates **gamification** and **machine learning** in chatbot development. The proposal outlines stages for planning, implementation, and analysis of gamified chatbots, composing a methodology adaptable to different project requirements.

The study was supervised by **Prof. Sergio Antônio Andrade de Freitas** and co-authored with **Prof. Cristiane Soares Ramos** (CEDIS/UnB).
