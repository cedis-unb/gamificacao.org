On Friday, October 24, 2025, Lucas Pereira Gomes Linard presented to the Gamificação.ORG community the results of his master's research on gamification applications in software development teams.

The presentation covered strategies and methodologies for implementing gamification mechanics aimed at enhancing engagement, collaboration, and productivity in corporate environments. Lucas shared practical challenges, solutions implemented in a case study at Banco do Brasil, and measurable results from the application.
