Gamificação.ORG is a research and collaboration group connected to the [Center for Studies, Development, and Innovation in Software (CEDIS)](https://cedis.unb.br) at the University of Brasília (UnB). It was born out of the [gamification research line](https://cedis.unb.br/areas/gamification) at CEDIS, which since 2015 has brought together academic works, experimental projects, and interdisciplinary initiatives focused on the use of gamification strategies to foster motivation, engagement, and innovation.

## Origin and trajectory

Since 2015, faculty members, researchers, and students at UnB have carried out investigations in the field of gamification, covering contexts such as education, software engineering, usability, active learning, and motivational behavior. Gamificação.ORG emerged as a continuation and expansion of this path, consolidating itself as a hub for collaboration, exchange, and dissemination of results.

## Mission

The mission of Gamificação.ORG is to act as a meeting point for all those who research, apply, or are interested in gamification. Its main goals include:

- Bringing together and integrating researchers, students, and professionals from different areas
- Promoting scientific production and publication of research on gamification
- Stimulating collaborative interdisciplinary projects, both nationally and internationally
- Developing innovative solutions applied to educational, corporate, and social contexts
- Connecting academia, industry, and the public sector through gamified practices

## Stakeholders involved

The group is composed of professors, researchers, PhD and master’s students, and undergraduates. Beyond the academic environment, Gamificação.ORG collaborates with private companies, civil society organizations, and public sector institutions in projects that involve:

- **Education:** active learning methodologies and gamified platforms
- **Public sector:** consultancy, social engagement projects, and educational policies
- **Companies and industry:** training programs, innovation management, and user experience
- **Civil society:** digital inclusion initiatives, health, and community mobilization
